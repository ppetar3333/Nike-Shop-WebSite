    <h1>History</h1>
</div>
<p class="text1"> Nike, formerly (1964–78) <b>Blue Ribbon Sports</b>, American sportswear company headquartered in
    Beaverton, Oregon.
    It was founded in 1964 as <b>Blue Ribbon Sports</b> by <b>Bill Bowerman</b>, a track-and-field coach at the <b>University
        of Oregon</b>,
    and his former student <b>Phil Knight</b>.
</p>
<p class="text2">They opened their first retail outlet in 1966 and launched <b>the Nike brand shoe in 1972</b>. The
    company was renamed <b>Nike</b>,
    , in 1978 and went public two years later.
</p>
<p class="text3">By the early 21st century, Nike had retail outlets and distributors in more than <b>170 countries</b>,
    and its logo—a curved
    check mark called the <b>“swoosh”</b> — was recognized throughout the world.</p>
<p class="text4"><big> Nike Logo </big>

</div>
<p class="text5">From the late <b>1980s</b> Nike steadily expanded its business and diversified its product line through
    numerous acquisitions,
    including the shoe companies <b>Cole Haan</b> (1988; sold in 2012) and Converse, Inc. (2003), the sports-equipment
    producer
    Canstar Sports, Inc. (1994; later called Bauer and sold in 2008), and the athletic apparel and equipment company
    Umbro
    (2008; sold in 2012).
</p>
<p class="text6">In <b>1996</b> the company created Nike ACG (“all-conditions gear”), which markets products for extreme
    sports such as
    snowboarding and mountain biking. In the early 21st century Nike began selling sports-technology accessories,
    including
    portable heart-rate monitors and high-altitude wrist compasses.
</p>
<p class="text7">Part of Nike’s success is owed to endorsements by such athletes as <b>Michael Jordan, Mia Hamm, Roger
    Federer,
    and Tiger Woods.</b> The NikeTown chain stores, the first of which opened in <b>1990</b>, pay tribute to these and
    other company
    spokespersons while offering consumers a full range of <b>Nike products.</b> In the <b>1990s</b> the company’s image
    briefly suffered
    from revelations about poor working conditions in its overseas factories.
